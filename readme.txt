Give website visitors an easy way to contact you, directly through your website, with a simple contact form.

== Description ==

Simple Contact Form (Basic) by nCroud is a lightweight and easy to use contact form plugin for almost any WordPress website. It allows website visitors to send an email directly through your website, to the WordPress administrator email, or the email of your choice.

This is the perfect contact form for personal websites, as well as websites for small businesses or non-profit organizations!

Simple Contact Form (Basic) collects four pieces of information about the visitor: Name, Email, Phone Number, and the Message. The Name, Email, and Message are required for the form to be submitted and processed. As part of the processing, before the email is actually sent, data validation ensures that the required fields are provided, and that a valid email address has been given. This ensures you are able to respond to visitor requests, if needed.

Availabe in English and Spanish! (Disponible en las idiomas de Ingl&eacute;s y Espa&ntilde;ol!)


== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'simple-contact-form-basic' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory, OR upload the 'simple-contact-form-basic.zip' file directly through the WordPress Admin Dashboard by navigating to 'Plugins -> Add New' and clicking on the 'Upload Plugin' button.
2. Activate the 'Simple Contact Form (Basic)' plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Add the [simplecf] shortcode to any of your WordPress Pages, Posts, or Text Widget areas.
4. Add the "scfb_to" variable to the [simplecf] shortcode to define an alternative delivery email. For example: [simplecf scfb_to=jdoe@ncroud.com] would install a form on your WordPress page/blog and all submissions for that particular form would be sent to jdoe@ncroud.com instead of the WordPress administrator email.
5. Add the "scfb_lan" variable to the [simplecf] shortcode to define the language (es = Spanish; en = English). If nothing is specified, the form will default to English.  For example:  [simplecf scfb_lan=es] would install a form on your WordPress page/blog in the Spanish language.
